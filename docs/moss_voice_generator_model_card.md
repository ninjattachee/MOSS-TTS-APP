# MOSS-VoiceGenerator Model Card

**MOSS-VoiceGenerator** is an open-source voice generation system designed to enable the creation of custom speaker timbres from free-form textual descriptions. This model allows users to generate voices that reflect specific characters, personalities, and emotions. It is particularly notable for its ability to produce speech with natural-sounding emotional expressiveness, providing a realistic and nuanced listening experience. As an open-source tool, MOSS Voice Generator is suitable for a variety of applications, such as audiobooks, game dubbing, role-playing agents, and conversational assistants.

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 TTS Family Positioning

**MOSS-VoiceGenerator** is a high-fidelity voice design tool within the broader TTS Family. It specializes in crafting expressive and natural-sounding voices from textual descriptions. Unlike traditional TTS systems relying on predefined voices or reference audio, MOSS-VoiceGenerator enables zero-shot voice design, allowing for the creation of customized voices for a variety of applications, such as characters, audiobooks, games, or virtual assistants. Additionally, it can serve as a voice design layer for other TTS systems, addressing the challenge of finding suitable reference audio and improving integration and performance.

**Key Capabilities**
* **Highly expressive emotional delivery**: Aimed at generating voices with dynamic and nuanced emotional performances, allowing for natural shifts in tone, pace, and emotion.
* **Human-Like Naturalness** : Indistinguishable from real human speech with authentic breathing, pauses, and vocal nuances
* **Multilingual Support** : High-quality synthesis in Chinese and English

### 1.2 Model Architecture
**MOSS-VoiceGenerator** employs MossTTSDelay architecture (see [moss_tts_delay/README.md](../moss_tts_delay/README.md) for more details), where voice description instructions and the text to be synthesized are concatenated and jointly tokenized as input to drive speech generation, enabling unified modeling of timbre design, style control, and content synthesis. Through instruction-timbre alignment, the model learns the correspondence between textual descriptions and acoustic features, allowing it to generate high-fidelity speech with target timbre, emotion, and style directly from free-form text prompts—without requiring any reference audio.

### Input Types

**UserMessage**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `text` | `str` | Yes | Text to synthesize. Supports Chinese and English. |
| `instruction` | `str` | Yes | Specify the style or the synthesized speech. Users can provide detailed speech style instructions, such as emotion, speed, pitch, and voice characteristics. |


### Generation Hyperparameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `audio_temperature` | `float` | 1.5 | Higher values increase variation; lower values stabilize prosody. |
| `audio_top_p` | `float` | 0.6 | Nucleus sampling cutoff. Lower values are more conservative. |
| `audio_top_k` | `int` | 50 | Top-K sampling. Lower values tighten sampling space. |
| `audio_repetition_penalty` | `float` | 1.1 | >1.0 discourages repeating patterns. |

> Note: MOSS-VoiceGenerator is **sensitive to decoding hyperparameters**. See **Released Models** for recommended defaults.

## 3. Performance

MOSS-VoiceGenerator demonstrates significant advantages in subjective evaluation. Using 160 internal test samples covering diverse voice styles, we established three independent evaluation dimensions: (1) **Overall Preference** - Which voice would you choose? (2) **Instruction Following** - Which audio best follows the instructions (gender, age, tone, emotion, accent, speed)? (3) **Naturalness** - Which audio sounds most like real human speech? Results show that **MOSS-VoiceGenerator outperforms all TTS systems** that support zero predefined voices and customizable preview text across these three dimensions.
